# Claude

Tracks your Claude subscription limits using the login you already have from Claude Code or Claude Desktop.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Session | 5-hour rolling window usage |
| Weekly | 7-day window usage |
| Sonnet | Separate weekly Sonnet limit (plan-dependent) |
| Fable | Separate weekly Fable limit (model-scoped window from the `limits` array) |
| Extra Usage | Extra-usage credits spent against your monthly cap |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Local spend, as cost, tokens, or both (see below) |

When Claude reports your plan name, OpenUsage shows it beside the provider name.

## Where credentials come from

Sign in with Claude Code or Claude Desktop; OpenUsage reads the existing login. It checks these sources, preferring one that can read your subscription usage:

1. The macOS keychain entry Claude Code maintains (its source of truth on macOS)
2. `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`)
3. Claude Desktop's encrypted login cache, when no working Claude Code login is available
4. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

Claude Desktop support is read-only. OpenUsage decrypts its currently valid access token using the
`Claude Safe Storage` item in your macOS Keychain. It never reads or uses Desktop's refresh token, and
never changes Desktop's config, cookies, or Keychain entry. This prevents OpenUsage from invalidating
Claude Desktop's session.

macOS asks once before OpenUsage can access that Keychain item. Background refreshes never open the
password dialog: OpenUsage first asks you to refresh manually, and choosing **Always Allow** makes later
refreshes silent. If Desktop's short-lived token expires, open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login,
then refresh OpenUsage.

A `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — usually a long-lived `claude setup-token` — can run the model but can't read your Session and Weekly limits, and it often lingers in your shell environment. So when a real keychain or file login is present, OpenUsage uses that login for the live meters and keeps the environment token only as a fallback; the Session/Weekly meters no longer go blank just because that token is set. If the environment token is your *only* credential (a headless setup), it's used on its own and the spend tiles still load from local logs.

If one source holds an expired or "locked out" token, OpenUsage falls back to the others — so signing in again with `claude` outside the app is picked up on the next refresh, without restarting OpenUsage. Claude Code tokens are refreshed automatically; rotated tokens are written back only while the ordered login candidates still match the start of the refresh, so a newly added higher-priority login wins. Claude Desktop tokens are never refreshed or written by OpenUsage.

## The spend tiles

Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days are computed **locally**: OpenUsage reads the Claude Code session logs under `~/.claude/projects/` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) itself — no external tools needed. Symlinks are followed, so a projects folder linked into a synced location (say, a Dropbox folder) is read all the same. Claude usage from other coding agents counts too. OpenUsage reads [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) session logs under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` (or `$PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`) and Xal's prompt-free usage ledger under `~/.xal/usage/` (or `$XAL_HOME/usage/`), then folds their Anthropic usage into the same tiles and trend. pi records its own per-message cost, so those dollars come straight from pi; Xal's measured token counts are estimated with the shared pricing engine. Cowork (the Claude desktop app's agent mode) counts too: it writes the same logs into per-session folders under `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/`, and OpenUsage scans those as well, so desktop agent sessions show up in the tiles alongside terminal ones. Persisted `claude -p` runs count as well. Runs made with `--no-session-persistence` cannot appear because Claude deliberately writes no session log for OpenUsage to read. Advisor work recorded inside a message is counted once under the advisor's own model; the parent's main-model totals are kept separate, and ordinary iteration details are not counted again. A log's recorded fast or standard speed controls its price; OpenUsage does not infer speed from the event date. Days are grouped in your Mac's local time zone, so they line up with your own calendar. Each period is one tile showing cost and tokens together (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`); a day with no usage reads **No data** rather than a misleading `$0.00 · 0 tokens` — the same as every other spend-tracking provider. The live Session and Weekly meters are unaffected. The dollars are estimated from token counts at API rates (that's the ⓘ) using the shared [model pricing](../pricing.md); the token counts themselves are measured. No log data leaves your Mac.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in"** — run `claude` and sign in, then refresh.
- **"Claude Desktop login found"** — refresh manually and choose **Always Allow** when macOS asks for access to `Claude Safe Storage`.
- **"Claude Desktop login is stale"** — open Claude Desktop so it can renew the login, then refresh OpenUsage.
- **"Re-login for live usage"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — your saved login can authenticate for inference but can't read your subscription limits, because it lacks the `user:profile` access (this is what an inference-only token from `claude setup-token` carries). Run `claude` and sign in again with your Claude account, then refresh; the spend tiles keep working in the meantime.
- **"Updates blocked by Anthropic"** (an amber warning on the Claude header) — the usage API is throttling OpenUsage. It keeps the last values from the same login, shows when it will retry, and backs off in the meantime. A different login starts with a fresh cache and cooldown.
- **Spend tiles show "No data"** — OpenUsage found no Claude Code logs in the last 30 days. If your logs live somewhere custom, set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so both Claude Code and OpenUsage look in the same place.

## Under the hood

`GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with the selected OAuth token. Claude Code tokens refresh via `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token`; Claude Desktop tokens are read-only and must be renewed by Desktop itself. If a token is expired or revoked, OpenUsage retries with the next credential source before reporting an error.

When the five-hour session window has no usage yet, the Session row shows **Not started** on the trailing label; hover explains that the session begins after your first message.
